This python script allows you to download multiple csv files (from copilot metrics or anywhere else) to a /files directory.  
When the script is run it combines all of the csv files in the "/files" directory into an excel spreadsheet.
It then formats the column widths and row heights and removes some redundant text from a response column.

Dependencies:

pip install

pandas
openpyxl
